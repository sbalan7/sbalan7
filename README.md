### Hello there!

I'm Shanmugha Balan, a student at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus pursuing a masters in physics. I am interested in making boxes of metal think.

I'm currently working on machine learning and artifical intelligence.
I'm learning computational biology and scientific computing.
My preferred languages are C/C++ and python.

Cool stuff:

A computational biology project with graph theory using NetworkX and python - [RSIC - 2018](https://github.com/sbalan7/RSIC-2018)

Some random programs with convolutional neural networks - [ConvNets](https://github.com/sbalan7/ConvNets)

A traffic sign classifier with a GUI - [Traffic-Sign-Classifier](https://github.com/sbalan7/Traffic-Sign-Classifier)

To learn:

Deep Learning from deeplearning.ai on Coursera - [Notes](https://sbalan7.github.io/assets/notes/deeplearning.pdf) | [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/sbalan7/LearningDeepLearning)

Machine Learning with scikit-learn - [Notes](https://sbalan7.github.io/assets/notes/machine_learning.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/sbalan7/ML-and-Stats)
